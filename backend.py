###   HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM   ###
# 1. Open up a terminal
# 2. Enter the command: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
#       This ends an apache server that runs on boot. When running, it uses port 80,
#       which is the port we want to use with this program.
# 3. Connect to the wifi network: Lenovo PHAB2 Pro
#       This is only necessary if you are running this script at the MSU campus.
#       MSU's firewall stops the flask server from serving the webpage for some reason.
#       The important thing is that you can run the script while connected to network
#       That won't prevent you from serving the webpage.
# 4. Run this script in the terminal
#       The exact command depends on where the file is located, but the current command is
#       sudo python3 ROBOT/01_Assignment2/backend.py
# 5. If you receive no errors after running the command in the terminal, open a browser
#       and enter the IP address of the Pi. You can find the IP address by hover the mouse
#       over the wifi symbol in the top right of the screen.
# 6. To stop the flask server, press 'Ctrl-c' while focused on the terminal.
